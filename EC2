## Features
+ Multiple Locations
Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations. Amazon EC2 locations are composed of Regions and Availability Zones.
Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, 
low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones,
you can protect your applications from failure of a single location. Regions consist of one or more Availability Zones and are geographically dispersed. 
The Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement commitment is 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 Region. Please refer to Regional Products and Services for more details of our product and service availability by region.
