# What is Amazon EC2?

+ ✔ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
+ ✔ Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
+ ✔ Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
+ ✔ Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

## Use cases
1. Run Cloud-Native and Enterprise Applications
+ Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
2. Scale for HPC Applications
+ Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.

## Features
+ Multiple Locations
Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations. Amazon EC2 locations are composed of Regions and Availability Zones.
Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, 
low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones,
you can protect your applications from failure of a single location. Regions consist of one or more Availability Zones and are geographically dispersed. 
The Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement commitment is 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 Region. Please refer to Regional Products and Services for more details of our product and service availability by region.

## Storage
+ Optimal storage for every workload
Different Amazon EC2 workloads can have vastly different storage requirements. Amazon cloud storage is reliable, scalable, and secure storage for your data.
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is an easy to use, high performance block storage.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage with industry-leading scalability, availability, and security.
- For file storage, Amazon offers a complete portfolio including Amazon EFS which provides simple, scalable, persistent, fully managed cloud file storage for shared access.
- Amazon FSx file storage offerings deliver fully managed, cost-effective file storage with the capabilities and performance of popular commercial and open-source file systems.

## Networking
+ High Packet-Per-Second Performance and Low Latency with Enhanced Networking
Enhanced Networking enables you to get significantly higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower network jitter and lower latencies. This feature uses a network virtualization stack that provides
higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional implementations.

## Operating Systems and Software
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are preconfigured with an ever-growing list of operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Linux distributions such as Amazon Linux 2,
Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, SUSE and Debian. We work with our partners and community to provide you with the most choice possible. 
The AWS Marketplace features a wide selection of commercial and free software from well-known vendors, designed to run on your EC2 instances.
## Maintenance
AWS regularly performs routine hardware, software, power, and network maintenance with minimal disruption across all EC2 instance types.
